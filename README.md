# Global UID Plugin

## Summary

This plugin does a lot of the heavy lifting needed to have an external MySQL based global id generator as described in this article from Flickr

(http://code.flickr.com/blog/2010/02/08/ticket-servers-distributed-unique-primary-keys-on-the-cheap/)

There are three parts to it: configuration, migration and object creation

### Interactions with other databases

This plugin shouldn't fail with Databases other than MySQL but neither will it do anything either. There's theoretically nothing that should stop it from being *ported* to other DBs, we just don't need to.

## Installation

Shove this in your Gemfile and smoke it

    gem "global_uid", :git => "git://github.com/zendesk/global_uid.git"

### Configuration

First configure some databases in database.yml in the normal way.

    id_server_1:
      adapter: mysql
      host: id_server_db1.prod
      port: 3306

    id_server_2:
        adapter: mysql
        host: id_server_db2.prod
        port: 3306

Then setup these servers, and other defaults in your environment.rb:

    GlobalUid.default_options = {
      :id_servers => [ 'id_server_1', 'id_server_2' ],
      :increment_by => 3
    }

Here's a complete list of the options you can use:

    Name                  Default
    :disabled             false                         
            Disable GlobalUid entirely

    :dry_run              false                         
            Setting this parameter causes the REPLACE INTO statements to run, but the id picked up will not be used.

    :connection_timeout   3 seconds                    
            Timeout for connecting to a global UID server

    :query_timeout        10 seconds                    
            Timeout for retrieving a global UID from a server before we move on to the next server

    :connection_retry     10.minutes
            After failing to connect or query a UID server, how long before we retry

    :notifier             A proc calling ActiveRecord::Base.logger
            This proc is called with two parameters upon UID server failure -- an exception and a message

    :increment_by         5
            Chooses the step size for the increment.  This will define the maximum number of UID servers you can have.

### Testing

    mysqladmin -uroot create global_uid_test
    mysqladmin -uroot create global_uid_test_id_server_1
    mysqladmin -uroot create global_uid_test_id_server_2

Copy test/config/database.yml.example to test/config/database.yml and make the modifications you need to point it to 2 local MySQL databases. Then +rake test+

### Migration

Migrations will now add global_uid tables for you by default.  They will also change
your primary keys from signature "PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL" to "PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL".

If you'd like to disable this behavior, you can write:

    class CreateFoos < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def self.up
        create_table :foos, :use_global_uid => false do |t|


## Model-level stuff

If you want GlobalUIDs created, you don't have to do anything except set up the GlobalUID tables
with your migration.  Everything will be taken care you.  It's calm, and soothing like aloe.
It's the Rails way.


### Disabling global uid per table

    class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
      disable_global_uid
    end


## Taking matters into your own hands:


	class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
		disable_global_uid

		def before_create
		  self.id = generate_uid()
		  # other stuff
		  ....
		end

	end

If you're using a non standard uid table then pass that in.

    generate_uid(:uid_table => '<name>')
